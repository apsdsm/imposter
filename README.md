# Imposter

Provides helper classes for writing tests that rely on fakes.

You still need to declare the fake class, and flesh out the functions, but Imposter makes it easier to check if any calls were made (or not made) to specific functions, with specific combinations of parameters.

Examples of use can be seen in the test file.
